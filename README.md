I'm always exploring new technologies like Unreal Engine, C++, Python. Currently learning more about:

- Multiplayer systems in UE5
- AI and behavior trees
- Vulkan graphics
- Procedural generation

Some projects I've worked on recently:

- Built a simple 2D platformer game in UE5
- Created a plugin for procedurally generating landscapes 
- Experimented with GANs to generate game assets

In my free time you can find me playing games 🎮, building electronics projects 🤖, and tinkering with 3D printing 🖨️.

Fun fact: I built a mini electric go kart that goes 25 mph! 🏎️
